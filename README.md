# low_light_image_enhancement
This repository contains the code for low light image enhancement.
## Methodology

It's known that the image often suffer degradations due to the environment and equipment limitations, such as low contrast,so The goal of low_light image enhancement is to learn a mapping from an image to a normal-light version.

We can assume that the image can be decomposed into two feature components in the latent space, namely the content component and the luminance component
